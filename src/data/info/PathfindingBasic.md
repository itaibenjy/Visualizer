#### How To Use Our Pathfinding Visualization Tool

The following guide will assist you in understanding how to interact with our React-based Pathfinding Visualizer. As you follow along, make sure to refer to the accompanying GIF for visual assistance.


**Step 1: Familiarize Yourself with the Grid**

Upon landing on the page, you'll be greeted by a grid which represents your 'world'. Each cell in the grid can be an open space, a wall, or a special point (start or end). 

**Step 2: Placing the Walls**

To create a wall, simply click and hold your mouse on an empty cell and drag it across the grid. As you drag, the cells will fill in, forming a wall. You can release the mouse button to stop drawing. Create as many walls as you want to make the pathfinding problem more challenging. 

**Step 3: Moving the Start and End Points**

By default, there are start and end points marked on your grid. To move these points, click and hold the mouse button over the start or end point, and then drag it to a new location on the grid. Release the mouse button to place the point. The pathfinding algorithm will use these points as the start and end of its journey.

**Step 4: Removing Walls**

To remove a wall, follow a process similar to creating a wall. Click and hold your mouse over a wall cell, then drag it across the wall that you want to erase. The cells will return to their empty state.

Remember, the purpose of this tool is to help you visualize different pathfinding algorithms. You can set up the grid with walls and points, and then run the algorithm to see how it finds a path from the start to the end point. This gives you a practical understanding of how these algorithms operate. 

Feel free to experiment with different grid configurations and see how the pathfinding algorithm responds. This is an excellent way to explore and learn about the fascinating world of pathfinding.
