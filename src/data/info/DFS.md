### About

Depth-First Search (DFS) is a traversal/search algorithm for trees and graphs. The algorithm starts at a root node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

In other words, DFS dives deep into a tree or graph, visiting a node and all its children before visiting any of its siblings.

### Algorithm Pseudocode `DFS(graph, startNode)`
1. Create an empty Stack and push startNode into it.
2. While the Stack is not empty,
    1. Pop a node from the Stack, and mark it as 'visited'.
    2. Check if the popped node is the end node. If it is, return 'success'.
    3. Push all unvisited neighbors of the node into the Stack.
3. If all nodes are visited and the end node is not found, return 'failure'.

### Benefits of Depth-First Search (DFS)

1. **Less Memory:** Unlike Breadth-First Search, DFS doesn't need to store all nodes of a level.

2. **Paths:** DFS could be useful in situations where finding any path is more important than finding the shortest path. 

3. **Connected Components:** DFS can be used to find connected components in a graph.

### Drawbacks of Depth-First Search (DFS)

1. **Not Shortest Path:** DFS does not guarantee the shortest path.

2. **May not terminate for infinite paths:** If there are infinite paths, DFS could go on infinitely and may not terminate.

3. **Non-optimal solution:** DFS might lead you to a solution, but it won't always be the optimal solution, especially when there are weighted edges involved.

### JavaScript Implementation

```js
// Define the main DFS function
function DFS(grid, start, end) {
    // Initialize an empty stack and push the start node into it
    const stack = [start];
    let found = false;

    // Continue until all nodes have been visited
    while (stack.length > 0) {
        // Pop the node from the top of the stack
        let currentNode = stack.pop();

        // If we reach the end node, we've found a path and can exit
        if (currentNode === end) {
            found = true;
            break;
        }

        // Check all neighboring nodes
        let neighbors = getNeighbors(grid, currentNode);
        for (let neighbor of neighbors) {
            // If the neighbor has not been visited, mark it as visited and add it to the stack
            if (!neighbor.isVisited) {
                neighbor.isVisited = true;
                stack.push(neighbor);
            }
        }
    }

    // Once all nodes are visited, if the end node is found, return the path
    if (found) {
        return getPath(end);
    } else {
        // If end node not found, return an empty path
        return [];
    }
}

// Helper function to get all unvisited neighbors
function getNeighbors(grid, node) {
    let neighbors = [];
    let { row, col } = node;
    if (row < grid.length - 1) neighbors.push(grid[row + 1][col]);
    if (col < grid[0].length - 1) neighbors.push(grid[row][col + 1]);
    if (row > 0) neighbors.push(grid[row - 1][col]);
    if (col > 0) neighbors.push(grid[row][col - 1]);
    return neighbors.filter(neighbor => !neighbor.isVisited);
}

// Helper function to construct the path from start to end node
function getPath(end) {
    let path = [];
    let currentNode = end;
    while (currentNode !== null) {
        path.unshift(currentNode);
        currentNode = currentNode.previousNode;
    }
    return path;
}
```
The code snippet above performs a depth-first search from a given start node to an end node in a given grid of nodes. The `DFS` function keeps track of all visited nodes to avoid visiting the same node more than once. It uses a stack data structure to keep track of nodes that have been discovered but not yet explored. 

After all neighbors of a node have been visited, the node is popped from the stack and the search continues with the next node from the stack. This continues until the stack is empty, meaning all reachable nodes have been visited and there are no more nodes to explore, or until the end node has been found.
