#### Post-Run Interactions and Real-Time Algorithm Visualization

Our Pathfinding Visualizer offers a unique way to interact with your grid even after the pathfinding algorithm has completed its run. This post-run interaction facilitates a dynamic learning experience, as you can observe the algorithm responding to changes in real-time. Follow along with the accompanying GIF for a visual demonstration.

**Step 1: Completing the Initial Visualization**

Once you've set up your grid, chosen an algorithm, and hit "Start Visualizing", the algorithm will traverse the grid and create a path from the start to the end point. After this process is complete, you're ready to interact further.

**Step 2: Post-Run Interactions**

When the initial run has ended, you can still interact with the grid. Here are the modifications you can make:

1. **Move the Start or End Point:** Click and drag the start or end point to a different cell on the grid. The pathfinding algorithm will immediately respond to this change and recompute the path in real-time.

2. **Add or Remove Walls:** Click and drag your mouse across the grid to add new walls or erase existing ones. The algorithm will instantly adjust to these changes, finding a new path that reflects the updated grid.

Although these interactions are post-run, they are rendered in real-time. This means as soon as you make a change, the algorithm springs into action, visualizing the new path based on your alterations. This dynamic interaction gives you a deeper understanding of how these algorithms respond to changes in their environment.

So don't hesitate to experiment! Move points, add or remove walls, and see how your changes influence the pathfinding process. This is a wonderful way to explore the intricacies and behavior of different pathfinding algorithms. Happy visualizing!
