### About

Swarm search is a pathfinding algorithm that utilizes multiple searching agents (a 'swarm') simultaneously. Each agent moves independently, typically in random directions. Once any agent reaches the destination, the path that the agent took is considered as a valid path.

Swarm search is especially effective in open spaces with less obstacles, as it allows the agents to cover a large area faster than traditional algorithms like DFS or BFS.

### Algorithm Pseudocode `SwarmSearch(graph, startNode, endNode)`
1. Initialize an array of Agents at the startNode.
2. While the search is not finished,
    1. Move each agent in a random direction.
    2. Check if any agent has reached the endNode. If it has, finish the search.
    3. Remove any agents that have returned to the startNode or cannot move.
    4. Replenish the array with new agents at the startNode to maintain the swarm size.
3. If an agent reached the endNode, construct the path from startNode to endNode.

### Benefits:
1. **Exploration Efficiency:** Swarm search efficiently explores the search space by utilizing multiple agents in parallel.
2. **Robustness to Obstacles:** Swarm search is robust to obstacles as agents can navigate around them by taking different paths.
3. **Flexibility in Search Space:** Swarm search is flexible and can be applied to various types of search spaces.
4. **Distributed Nature:** Swarm search is a distributed algorithm, allowing for decentralized and collaborative search.

### Drawbacks:
1. **Sub-Optimal Paths:** Swarm search may find sub-optimal paths as agents explore the search space independently.
2. **Sensitivity to Swarm Size:** The performance of swarm search can be sensitive to the number of agents used.
3. **Limited Search Strategy:** Swarm search may have a limited search strategy compared to other advanced algorithms.
4. **Sensitivity to Initial Conditions:** Swarm search may yield different results based on the initial conditions and configuration of agents.

```js
class Agent {
    constructor(startNode, node = startNode) {
        this.startNode = startNode;
        this.node = node;
    }

    // Function to move the agent in a random direction
    move(grid) {
        let directions = [[-1, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0], [0, -1]];
        directions.sort(() => Math.random() - 0.5);

        while (true) {
            for (let direction of directions) {
                let newX = this.node.row + direction[0];
                let newY = this.node.col + direction[1];

                if (newX >= 0 && newY >= 0 && newX < grid.length && newY < grid[0].length) {
                    let newNode = grid[newX][newY];
                    if (!newNode.isWall && !newNode.isVisited) {
                        newNode.isVisited = true;
                        newNode.previousNode = this.node;
                        this.node = newNode;
                        return newNode;
                    }
                }
            }
            this.node = this.node.previousNode;
            if (this.node === this.startNode || this.node === null) {
                return this.node;
            }
        }
    }
}

// Main swarm search function
function swarmSearch(grid, startNode, endNode, numberOfAgents = 8) {
    let agents = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < numberOfAgents; i++) {
        agents.push(new Agent(startNode));
    }

    let finished = false;
    let endAgent = null;

    while (!finished) {
        let moves = agents.map(agent => agent.move(grid));

        let newNodes = await Promise.all(moves);

        for (let i = 0; i < newNodes.length; i++) {
            if (newNodes[i] && newNodes[i].isEnd) {
                finished = true;
                endAgent = agents[i];
                break;
            }
        }

        agents = agents.filter(agent => agent.node !== startNode && agent.node !== null);

        for (let k = 0; k < numberOfAgents - agents.length; k++) {
            agents.push(new Agent(startNode, agents[0].node));
        }
    }

    let path = [];
    if (endAgent) {
        let node = endAgent.node;
        while (node.col !== startNode.col || node.row !== startNode.row) {
            path.unshift(node);
            node = node.previousNode;
        }
    }

    return {
        path: path,
        found: !!endAgent,
    };
}
```

In the code

 above, an Agent is defined with methods for movement, and the Swarm Search algorithm is implemented with the help of these agents. 

The Agent tries to move in random directions, backtracking when there are no valid directions to move. In Swarm Search, multiple such agents are initialized and moved independently. When any of these agents reach the destination, the search is concluded, and the path followed by the successful agent is considered as the found path.

If an agent finds itself back at the start node, or if there are no valid moves left, that agent is removed from the search. New agents are created and added to the search in order to maintain the size of the swarm.

The final path is then determined by the path of the agent which reached the destination first.
