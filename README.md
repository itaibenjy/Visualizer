## My Personal Exploration into Algorithms and Programming

Programming, at its core, is about learning, problem-solving, and continuous growth. As a Software Engineering student, I started Visualizer as a personal project to help me better understand and appreciate the intricacies of algorithms.

Here, I share my ongoing learning journey with you, visualizing algorithms in a way that makes them more approachable and comprehensible.

## My Progress So Far

I've spent countless hours diving into the world of Sudoku and Sorting algorithms, turning them into interactive visualizations. Using React, I've not only been able to better understand these algorithms but also to improve my coding skills. This is an ongoing journey, and every step brings a new lesson.

## Current Adventures

I have now embarked on the intriguing path of Pathfinding Algorithms, commencing with the A* Search and Breadth-First Search (BFS). As I dive deeper into this fascinating realm, I am eagerly sharing my progress and discoveries. Stay tuned for a detailed exploration of these techniques and more exciting revelations to come!
