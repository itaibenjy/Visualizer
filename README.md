Welcome to Visualizer
=====================

## My Personal Exploration into Algorithms and Programming

Programming, at its core, is about learning, problem-solving, and continuous growth. As a Software Engineering student, I started Visualizer as a personal project to help me better understand and appreciate the intricacies of algorithms.

Here, I share my ongoing learning journey with you, visualizing algorithms in a way that makes them more approachable and comprehensible.

## My Progress So Far

I've spent countless hours diving into the world of Sudoku and Sorting algorithms, turning them into interactive visualizations. Using React, I've not only been able to better understand these algorithms but also to improve my coding skills. This is an ongoing journey, and every step brings a new lesson.

## What's on the Horizon?

Next on my journey, I'm steering towards the labyrinth of Pathfinding Algorithms. From Dijkstra's Algorithm to A\* Search, I'm excited to dig deeper and share my learning progress with you. Keep an eye out for my upcoming explorations!

## Hi there, I'm Itai Benjamin, a budding programmer on a mission to enhance my understanding of algorithms and React.

As much as Visualizer is about my personal exploration, it's also a demonstration of my skills and passion for Software Engineering. Currently, I'm on the lookout for new job opportunities that will allow me to grow and contribute.

As I navigate through this vast sea of computational logic, I'll keep adding more to this collection.If you're interested in my work and have an opening in your organization, or simply want to discuss algorithms and programming, I would be thrilled to connect with you. Let's make something great together!

Feel free to share your thoughts, suggestions, and questions. Together, we can make algorithm learning a more engaging and collaborative adventure!Please feel free to reach out to me at itaibenjy@gmail.com.
