### Exploring the Controls of Our Pathfinding Visualization Tool

Our Pathfinding Visualizer isn't just a static tool. You have multiple interactive controls to modify your experience and better understand the pathfinding algorithms. The accompanying GIF will help you visualize these controls.

### Further Explanation

**Step 1: Adjusting Visualization Speed**

To change the speed of visualization, use the speed slider located on the control panel. Move the slider to the right for faster visualization, and to the left for slower visualization. This allows you to view the algorithm's steps at your own pace.

**Step 2: Selecting a Pathfinding Algorithm**

You can select different pathfinding algorithms to compare their behaviors. Use the algorithm dropdown menu, and click on the algorithm you'd like to run. The visualizer will update to use your chosen algorithm when you press the "Start Visualization" button.

**Step 3: Generating a Maze**

To quickly create a complex grid, use the "Generate Maze with DFS" button. This will create a maze using the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm, giving you a challenging scenario for your pathfinding algorithm.

**Step 4: Clearing the Grid**

There are two ways to clear your grid:

1. "Clear Visited and Path" Button: This will clear the paths and any visited cells from the grid, but it will keep the walls and the start and end points in place.

2. "Clear Board" Button: This will completely reset the grid, clearing all the walls, paths, and visited cells. The start and end points will remain, ready for you to create a new scenario.

**Step 5: Starting the Visualization**

Once you have set up your grid and selected your algorithm, click the "Start Visualizing" button. You will see the chosen algorithm in action, finding a path from the start to the end point.


Remember, the goal of this tool is to provide a hands-on experience and understanding of pathfinding algorithms. Feel free to explore, experiment, and learn!
