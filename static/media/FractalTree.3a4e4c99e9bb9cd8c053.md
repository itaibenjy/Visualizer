## Fractal Tree Visualizer
My Fractal Tree Visualizer is an interactive webpage that provides you with the ability to create and modify your own fractal tree.

## What is a Fractal Tree?

Fractal trees are a form of recursive, self-similar structures. They are a classic example of fractals: complex shapes formed by repeating a simple process. In a fractal tree, each branch splits into smaller branches, and this process is repeated, creating a tree-like structure. Despite the simplicity of the process, it can create intricately beautiful patterns.

## Features of the Fractal Tree Visualizer

With the Fractal Tree Visualizer, you can create your own fractal tree with a multitude of options, including:

**1. Angle:** This allows you to modify the angle between branches in your tree. It is a vital parameter for shaping your tree.

**2. Branches:** The Branches (depth) refers to how many times the branching process will be repeated. Higher depth values will result in more complex trees.

**3. Initial Size:** This determines the size of the first, or "trunk" branch of the tree.

**4. Branch Size Reducer:** This parameter controls how much each subsequent branch will be smaller than its parent branch.

**5. Favor Side:** By adjusting this, you can make your tree lean to one side, emulating the effects of growth in a particular direction or wind.

**6. Leafs:** You can select whether or not your tree will have leaves and if yes, you can choose their type. The options include regular, maple, and cherry blossom.

**7. Wind:** This option simulates the effect of wind on the tree, causing it to lean to one side and move as if blown by a breeze.

## How to Use

Simply the available sliders and buttons to adjust the parameters for your fractal tree. The tree will be drawn in real-time as you adjust the settings, allowing you to see the effects of your changes immediately.
